AncientOS v3.7

- OTA over-rides TWRP and Magisk!

- Completely rewrite FOD implementation (Faster and much much lesser flickering now)
- Upstream ClearVisionKernel
- Fix all APN problems (Mobile data working on my end now)
- Completely rewrite Android Auto fix (I can't test, if there are still problems, send logs)
